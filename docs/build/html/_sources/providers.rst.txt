NASA Earthdata mainly serves the data conservation for the NASA projects including big missions such as `SWOT <https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SWOT?sections=data>`_, field campaigns like the Submesoscale Ocean Dynamics (`S-MODE <https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/S-MODE?sections=data>`_), as well as NASA funded PI-led research projects (e.g., the `OSCAR project <https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/OSCAR_L4_OC_FINAL_V2.0?ids=&values=&search=oscar&provider=POCLOUD>`_). In addition, satellite data products from other agencies may be hosted per multi-agency agreement.

How to determine whether a dataset fits to PO.DAAC?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NASA missions
    should have made arrangement with ESDS on the project level usually before the launch of a satellite or a campaign.
For NASA-funded PI-led project,
    it is recommended to inform PODAAC as early as possible after a proposal is selected. The point of contact at PODAAC is the project scientist (Jinbo Wang) and the project manager (Suresh Vannan). After receiving the notice, we will work with the PI on data acquisition package to be submitted to ESDS for review and approval.

What about model data?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Numerical models can easily produce outputs on an order of petabytes. Determining their suitability to PODAAC is not always easy, but there are several guideline to follow.

#. Is the simulation sponsored by NASA missions and/or programs? For example, ECCO is sponsored by the NASA PO program. The ECCO simulation (llc4320) was sponsored by SWOT. Both of them are in PODAAC, but due to the size of the llc4320 (2 petabytes total), only a small subset is in PODAAC. This is a result of a discussion among SWOT Project scientist, PODAAC and ESDS.
#. Simulations that are less relevant to NASA are less likely eligible.
#. For questions, please send inquiries to the project scientist and manager.
