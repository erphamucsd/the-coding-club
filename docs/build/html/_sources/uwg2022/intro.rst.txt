Introduction
-------------

The User Working Group (UWG) is an important component of PO.DAAC. While UWG is not involved in PO.DAAC's daily operations, it provides PO.DAAC a crucial strategic guidence as well as direct feedback on the current data archives, tools and services. The annual UWG meeting is an important event for PO.DAAC to solicite feedback from UWG and make work plans for the new fiscal year.

The 2022 annual meeting will be held on August 4-5, 2022. Due to the on-going COVID19 situation, we offer hybrid option. The in-person meeting will be held at JPL. Online meeting will be on Webex.
