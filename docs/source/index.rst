Welcome to The Hitchhiker's Guide to PO.DAAC!
=============================================================

The NASA's Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC) is an element of the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), established during the late 1980s, the dawn of the modern satellite altimetry. The data archives have evolved from altimetry alone at the beginning to a wide variety of data products including major NASA missions such as Jason-series altimetry, Sentinel-6MF, GRACE and GRACE-follow on (GRACE-FO), as well field campaigns and commercial oceanography observations. PO.DAAC also provides tools and services for access and view data archives. PO.DAAC has been aggressively evolving along with rapidly increasing volume of data and the advancement of computing technologies. We are all hitchhikers at some point to this PO.DAAC. This document is designed to provide a brief overview of PO.DAAC, data achieves, basic tools and services. Hope you find this useful. Feedbacks are welcome (podaac@podaac.jpl.nasa.gov).

This guidebook is organized as follow. Section 1 introduces PO.DAAC's history. Section 2 introduces the current data archives. Section 3 walks you through the basic tools and services for data discovery and access. Section 4 is dedicated to cloud-related topics. Section 5 provides information for data providers. Section 6 provides information related to data and software management plans for NASA ROSES proposals. Section 7 collects the answers to some frequently asked questions (FAQs).

This document is under development. You may find empty and/or incomplete sections.
